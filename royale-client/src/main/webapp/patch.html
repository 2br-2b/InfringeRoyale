    <div class='p ver'>Version 1.0</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Jun 15 - Initial release</div>
    <div class='p splt'></div>
    <div class='p ver'>Version 1.0.1</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Jun 16 - Performance Patch</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Player count reduced to 75 from 99</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      Both the server and the game client struggle to handle a full 99 players so I'm reducing it for now to help alleviate performance issues on both the backend server and the client renderer.<br>
      I also feel like 99 players is a bit overly chaotic right at the start, so hopefully this will make it more manageable.<br>
      After all... Most battle royales spread their players over a large area. This game dumps them all in 1 place.
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>Renderer culling changes</div>
    <div class='p note'>Small change to slightly improve framerates.</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Experimental Server Performance Improvements</div>
    <div class='p note'>Made some changes to how the server writes game data to clients. Should be thread safe but may cause problems. I'll roll this back if it breaks things.</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Improved support for browsers that don't have a gamepad api</div>
    <div class='p note'>Hopefully fixes a few web browsers that like... no one uses...</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Fixed num0 key being wrong keycode</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Added more stuff you can't get in the lobby</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Planned stuff:</div>
    <div class='p note'>Hopefully will be able to add some new features soon.<br>Most requested features are: touch controls, squads, and rebindable controls.<br>Please look forward to it.</div>
