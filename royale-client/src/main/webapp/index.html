        Unfortunately, Uncle Nintindie's lawyers have informed me that, despite my best efforts, the game still infringes their copyright.<br>
        They refused to give me specifics (I asked multiple times) but it would seem that either the level design or general mechanics are still too close to the original game.<br>
        As a result I can't just blindly change the game and leave it up. Doing so would put me at risk of further legal action.<br>
        I'll likely talk in detail about the game and it's short lifespan on my youtube channel in the coming weeks.<br>
        I'm sorry about this guys. It was fun while it lasted.<br>
